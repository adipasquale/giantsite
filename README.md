# Huge Static Website Builder

A very simple script fetches 5000 photos from the [JSONPlaceholder Fake API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), and builds a static website with an index and one page per photo.

This is used as a support in an upcoming blog article

## Run

The script has no external dependency, **you just need to run it with Python 3+** :

```
python3 build.py
```
